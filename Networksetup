Network Setup
The last piece of the puzzel for a function cluster is networking. Below are the commands for installing Calico;

kubectl create -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
wget https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/custom-resources.yaml 
vi custom-resources.yaml
kubectl create -f ./k8s/install/custom-resources.yaml
copy
In the kubeadm init command we specified the pod network CIDR to be --pod-network-cidr=10.41.0.0/16 so when setting up Calico, we need to specify the same CIDR as below;

    ipPools:
    - blockSize: 26
      cidr: 10.41.0.0/16
      encapsulation: VXLANCrossSubnet
      natOutgoing: Enabled
      nodeSelector: all()
copy
Calico can be installed right after the master completes

Helpful commands
kubectl get nodes -w - returns all nodes in the cluster and let you know if the are ready. They will remain in the note-ready state until Calico installed completely. The -w is a wait flag that will continually echo the status of the nodes

kubectl get po -A -w - returns all pods from all namespaces and waits

Type control-c to exit the wait
